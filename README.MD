# Phaser Editor 2D v3 Monaco plugins

This repository contains the Monaco Editor plugins for Phaser Editor 2D. It is in its early stage.

By default, Phaser Editor 2D uses a very basic code editor based on CodeMirror.
We always suggest to use an advanced third editor like VS Code.

However, when running the editor in the cloud, it is better to use a built-in advanced
code editor. This Monaco plugin is the best option.
